Complete SRS Overview

The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document provides a comprehensive description of the E-Book Management System, including functional requirements, non-functional requirements, system constraints, and user characteristics.

The document serves as a blueprint for the development process and ensures that the system is built according to clearly defined requirements. By identifying user needs and system expectations early, the SRS minimizes development risks and improves project efficiency.

The final SRS document spans approximately 8–12 pages, covering introduction, problem statement, scope, stakeholder analysis, system features, and design considerations.
