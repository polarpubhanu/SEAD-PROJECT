1. Introduction
1.1 Document Purpose

The purpose of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document is to provide a detailed description of the requirements for the E-Book Management System. It defines the system’s functionalities, constraints, and overall behavior to guide the development process effectively.
This document serves as a reference for developers, project stakeholders, and system users to ensure a clear understanding of the proposed system before implementation. By outlining the requirements in advance, the SRS helps minimize misunderstandings, improves project planning, and supports the development of a secure, efficient, and user-friendly digital platform for managing e-books.

1.2 Scope
The E-Book Management System is designed to provide a centralized digital platform for storing, organizing, searching, and accessing electronic books efficiently. The system addresses the limitations of traditional book management methods by enabling users to access digital resources anytime and from any location.
Users will be able to browse books by categories, authors, or keywords, view detailed information, and access digital content conveniently. The system also includes an administrative module that allows administrators to upload e-books, manage metadata, control user access, and monitor system activities.
Additionally, the system emphasizes data security by implementing authentication mechanisms and access controls to protect digital content and user information. Overall, the platform aims to enhance accessibility, simplify book management processes, and improve the efficiency of digital resource utilization for both users and administrators.
